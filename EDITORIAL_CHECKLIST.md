// Editorial Checklist (Use This Before Shipping Any Pack)
•	Does every left card describe something you can point at?
•	Could a player understand every card without knowing the story?
•	Do right cards sound like margin notes, not essays?
•	Do sliders avoid leading language?
•	Would this still be fun if the player got every match “wrong”?
If yes → ship.
